## Getting Started

Today I decided to do something with one of my many domains - finally. That something was to create
a developer blog. There were a ton of ways to do this. I mean, if you just google blog you'll find 
a million different services that all want to create one for you. Since I've used most of the popular 
blogging engines and services - I went with something new this time. 

Made obvious by the title, I went with Jekyll. The static site and blog generator. 
I have to say, I was pleasantly suprised when I realized how easy it was to get setup. 
With Jekyll and using Github pages to host, I literally was up and running under a hour.
Suprisingly, Jekyll has very deep customization - something i'm very excited to delve deeper into. 

I'll wrap up this post for now. A update will be added when the blog is fleshed out a bit more.

## Getting Started

Today I decided to do something with one of my many domains - finally. That something was to create
a developer blog. There were a ton of ways to do this. I mean, if you just google blog you'll find 
a million different services. And guess what? all of them want to create one for you. Since I've used most of the popular blogging services already - I went with something new this time. 

Made obvious by the title, I went with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll"). The static site and blog generator. I have to say, I was pleasantly suprised when I realized how easy it was to get setup. It literally only took the following four commands to get started. Of course, you will need to make sure you have all the prerequisites installed before hand. If you're interested, those are listed [here](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ "Requirements"). 
	
Quick Start Commands:

	~ $ gem install jekyll
	~ $ jekyll new myblog
	~ $ cd myblog
	~/myblog $ jekyll serve

That was damn easy right? I know. I know. 

Anyways, with Jekyll and using [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/ "Github") to host, my site was live within an hour. What is Github pages you ask? Well, that's a post for another time - look forward to it. But, let's just say it's an awesome service provided by Github for thier users. Now, with Jekyll back in mind, I realized something that wasn't readily apparent at first. When you look a bit deeper into the open source project that is Jekyll. You will find a treasure trove of customization and flexability. For something that was so simple use, I wasn't expecting a lot of sophistication. With that said, I am really excited to delve deeper into this project. In the near future, I really want to have this blog looking nice and strutured to provide useful and engaging material. I'll wrap up this post for now. A update will be added when the blog is fleshed out a bit more.

Today I decided to do something with one of my many domains - finally. That something was to create
a developer blog. There were a ton of ways to do this. I mean, if you just google blog you'll find 
a million different services that all want to create one for you. Since I've used most of the popular 
blogging engines and services - I went with something new this time. 

As most can tell from the title, I went with Jekyll. The static site and blog generator. 
I have to say, I was pleasently suprised when I realized how easy it was to get setup. 
With Jekyll and using Github pages to host, I literally was up and running under a hour.
Suprisngly, Jekyll has very deep customization which I will definitely be taking advantage of. 

I'll wrap up this post for now. I'll add a new one when the blog is finished.

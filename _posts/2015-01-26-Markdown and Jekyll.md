## Getting to know Markdown

So, I've finally got my developer blog up and running. The task has been excited and exhausting all at the same time. Believe it or not, i've been playing around with jekyll for hours - literally. As a total noob to it, I've found that the learning curve isn't very bad. Surprisingly, while setting up this blog, It was the first time that i've ever used markdown. The term is not new to me. But, this was the first time i've ever put it into action. With that said, I've found that it's very simple yet very powerful. It'll definitely take some getting used to but, I think i'll grow to enjoy using it for blogging. 

Right now, the site is pretty bare bones. I prefer it this way. However, I do have a couple ideas in mind that will flesh it out a bit. Those ideas are listed below.

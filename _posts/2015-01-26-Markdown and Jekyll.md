## Getting to know Markdown

So, I've finally got my developer blog up and running. I've been playing around with jekyll for hours - literally. As a total noob to it, I've found that the learning curve isn't very bad. Surprisingly, while setting up this blog, It was the firt time i've ever used markdown. I knew what it was but I never used it before. It's suprisingly very simple but powerful. While, It'll definitely take some getting used to, I think i'll grow to enjoy using it for blogging. 

Right now, the site is pretty bare bones. I prefer it this way. Although, I do have a couple things in mind that will flesh it out a bit. Those ideas are listed below.

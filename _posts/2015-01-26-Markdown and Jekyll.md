## Getting to know Markdown

I've finally got my developer blog up and running. The task has been exciting and exhausting all at the same time.Believe it or not, i've been playing around with Jekyll for hours - literally. As a total noob to it, I found that the learning curve wasn't too bad though. Surprisingly, I have never really used much of [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "Markdown") before today. I mean, I've written the occassional README for a github repository. But, beyond that, I never had a reason to get to the know syntax. Luckily, it's super easy to use. Everything is pretty straight forward and pretty intutive if you ask me. [John Gruber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber "John Gruber") really created something amazing(He's the dude who created it by the way). I think I will enjoy using Markdown to fill this site with my ramblings and eventually useful content. 

###Anyways.....

The site in it's current state is pretty bare bones. I mean. I do prefer it this way. However, a couple ideas came to mind that will flesh it out a bit:

- About Page
- Resume Page
- Archive Page
- Comments for Posts
- Social Media Integration

I think I'll get working on that..

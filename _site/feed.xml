        <title>Markdown and Jekyll</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-to-know-markdown&quot;&gt;Getting to know Markdown&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve finally got my developer blog up and running. The task has been exciting and exhausting all at the same time. Believe it or not, i’ve been playing around with Jekyll for hours - literally. As a total noob to it, I found that the learning curve wasn’t too bad. Surprisingly, I have never really used much of &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot; title=&quot;Markdown&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; before today. I mean, I’ve written the occassional README for a github repository. But, beyond that, I never had a reason to get to the know syntax. Luckily, it’s super easy to use. Everything is pretty straight forward and pretty intuitive if you ask me. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber&quot; title=&quot;John Gruber&quot;&gt;John Gruber&lt;/a&gt; has really created something amazing(He’s the dude who created it by the way). I think I will enjoy using Markdown to fill this site with my ramblings and eventually useful content. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;anyways&quot;&gt;Anyways…..&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site in it’s current state is pretty bare bones. I mean. I do prefer it this way. However, a couple ideas came to mind that will flesh it out a bit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;About Page&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Resume Page&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Archive Page&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Comments for Posts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Social Media Integration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I’ll get working on that.. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Links:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

        <title>Playing Around With Jekyll</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-started&quot;&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I decided to do something with one of my many domains - finally. That something was to create
a developer blog. There were a ton of ways to do this. I mean, if you just google blog you’ll find 
a million different services. And guess what? all of them want to create one for you. Since I’ve used most of the popular blogging services already - I went with something new this time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Made obvious by the title, I went with &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot; title=&quot;Jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;. The static site and blog generator. I have to say, I was pleasantly suprised when I realized how easy it was to get setup. It literally only took the following four commands to get started. Of course, you will need to make sure you have all the prerequisites installed before hand. If you’re interested, those are listed &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/&quot; title=&quot;Requirements&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick Start Commands:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~ $ gem install jekyll
~ $ jekyll new myblog
~ $ cd myblog
~/myblog $ jekyll serve
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was damn easy right? I know. I know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, with Jekyll and using &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot; title=&quot;Github&quot;&gt;Github pages&lt;/a&gt; to host, my site was live within an hour. What is Github pages you ask? Well, that’s a post for another time - look forward to it. But, let’s just say it’s an awesome service provided by Github for thier users. Now, with Jekyll back in mind, I realized something that wasn’t readily apparent at first. When you look a bit deeper into the open source project that is Jekyll. You will find a treasure trove of customization and flexability. For something that is so simple use, I wasn’t expecting a lot of sophistication. With that said, I am really excited to delve deeper into this project. In the near future, I really want to have this blog looking nice and strutured to provide useful and engaging material. I’ll wrap up this post for now. A update will be added when the blog is fleshed out a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll: &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;http://jekyllrb.com/&lt;/a&gt;
Github Pages: &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;https://pages.github.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
